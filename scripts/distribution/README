* Before creating distribution, update/commit changes to repository and tag. So typically:
cvs update -Pd
cvs commit -m "if necessary"
cvs tag -R v1-2
sh create_and_upload_biana_distribution.sh v1-2 1.2

* For creating windows setup, it is required to have a windows installed with innodb setup and run inno_setup_script.iss (modify the paths inside as necessary). Then it should be uploaded to the webserver. 

* The web page should be updated so that, the new packages are made available.

create_and_upload_biana_distribution.sh: 
    - Takes 2 parameters: cvs tag to export and biana version to send to server(appended after biana.v)
    - Checks out that cvs version to biana_distribution
    - Compiles java & tex files
    - Calls create_windows_release.sh with biana_distribution

create_windows_release.sh:
    - Takes 1 parameter: folder where biana files reside
    - Uses windows_biana_release_files.tar.gz and MySQLdb_windows.tar.gz files to genereate windows_files_to_compile_with_innosetup.tar.gz

create_installer_in_windows.sh:
